I had about three weeks between my 3B study term and my work term at Canoo. I have not been back in Asia since my grad trip in 2016. After booking the flights and the AirBnB's, I was only an ocean away from the nations of Taiwan and Japan.

Why did I decide to go to Taiwan & Japan, **again**?

- Taiwan is a paradise for food-lovers and frugal travellers. I happen to be both.
- Japan has a weird dichotomy of future and past; the country houses serene shrines and bustling metropolises at the same time. Oh yeah, did I mention that my favorite food is sushi?

## Taiwan

**Day 1 - Taipei**

After a 15-hour ðŸ˜¢ flight from Toronto Pearson to Taipei Taoyuan, I met up with my friends at the AirBnB.

After some traditional Taiwanese breakfast, we explored the **Taipei Zoo** to see some Pandas. Due to the hot and humid air, the glass was too fogged up for me to snap a good photo. That night, we had a meal at the Yao Yue Tea Restaurant in Maokong, which is this mountainous region near the Zoo. We were greeted by mosquitoes, light drizzles, and of course, great food.

**Day 2 - Taipei**

![National Palace Museum](/static/images/asia_19/museum.jpg)

After struggling a bit with the jet-lag, we went to check out the **National Palace Museum**. The museum has over 700,000 pieces of ancient artifacts. I've always liked going to museums in big cities (The Met, National Museum of China, Art Institute of Chicago, etc.). Despite my aching feet at the end of the day, I was especially awed by the jade cabbage and the "forbidden snack".

**Day 3 - Jiufen**

![Jiufen](/static/images/asia_19/jiufen_1.jpg)

**Jiufen**, a scenic mountain town on the northeastern corner of the island, is the perfect day trip away from the busy city of Taipei. 

![Jiufen](/static/images/asia_19/jiufen_2.jpg)

Jiufen is home to the famous teahouse that resembles the town in Spirited Away. We already took enough pictures the last time we came, so we just grabbed some tasty snacks on the narrow, winding old street and headed down to the coast.

After driving down the serpentine highway, we arrived at **Yin Yang Sea**, **Golden Waterfall** and the **Remains of the 13 Levels**.

I really enjoyed these less well-known attractions. It was like seeing Jiufen from a brand new angle -- an angle with less tourists and more natural scenery and history. As the sun slowly set behind the Keelung mountains, we arrived at the last destination, Shifen Old Street.

The Old Street was lined with a bunch of lantern shops and restaurants on both sides of a train track. After taking a quick stroll on the Shifen Old Street, the night fell and we lit up some sky lanterns with good wishes written all over.

**Day 4 - Taipei**

The last full day in Taipei was spent shopping around Ximending and filling our stomaches with delicious food.

**Day 5 - Kaohsiung**

Around noon, after checking out of our AirBnB, we took the Taiwan High Speed Rail (HSR) from Taipei Main Station to Zuoying Station in Kaohsiung. Kaohsiung is a huge port city in southern Taiwan, home to many skyscrapers, cultural attractions, night markets, and of course, great food.

After dropping off our baggage, we rested a bit and headed to **Liuhe Night Market** via the MRT. On the way, we checked out the **Dome of Light** at the Formosa Boulevard Station.

Near the Formosa Boulevard Station exit, the Liuhe night market was lined with food stalls serving fresh seafood, meat, dumplings, noodles, and many other mouth-watering cheap eats. Definitely come here with an empty stomach and enjoy the variety of Taiwanese street food.

**Day 6 - Kaohsiung**

We went on a day-trip to **Cijin**, an island just west of Kaohsiung, for the first full day in Kaohsiung.

On the way, we strolled around **Pier-2 Art Center** just north of Cijin. The Pier-2 Art Center is a bunch of warehouses turned into art galleries, outdoor graffitis and sculptures.

Then, we headed for the island on a ferry.

After renting out a four-person cycle, we set out to explore the island. There were many instagram-worthy attractions such as the **Rainbow Church** and **Sea Pearl**

After a jam-packed day, we worked up quite the appetite. Duck Zhen was a local spot that serves, you guessed it, duck.

![duck zhen](/static/images/asia_19/cijin_duck.jpg)

We were lucky to get a table right when they opened for dinner; a line formed very quickly as we sat down. We were huge fans of the braised duck over rice and duck soup. With our stomachs full, we headed back to our AirBnB in Zuoying.

**Day 7 - Kaohsiung**

When we woke up, a typhoon was on its way to western Taiwan. So we stayed indoors and played at Tom's World arcade near our AirBnB.

Around dinner time, the skies cleared up and we went to a bar and Karaoke-ed our night away.

**Day 8 - Kaohsiung**

In the morning, we taxi-ed to Ren Wu Kao Ya (Ren Wu Roast Duck). We waited in line for about 30 minutes before devouring a plate of freshly-roasted duck.

In the afternoon, we strolled around the Kaohsiung Confucius Temple and Spring & Autumn Pavilions.
