I've revamped my website **too** many times in the past (almost twice per year). There are just too many possibilities for me to commit to. Should I just make a one-pager with an introduction and social links? Or should I make something completely out-of-this-world like [Bruno Simons](https://bruno-simon.com/).

Thinking back at the various rabbit holes my curiosity led me down, I've always followed what I considered to be **cool**. This could be anything from a cool bodymovin animation to an unique navigation layout. By frequently checking websites like [awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/), [dribbble](https://www.dribbble.com/), [codrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops/), [codepen](codepen.io), I accumulated an enormous amounts of bookmarks

<div style={{display:"flex"}}><img src="/static/images/welcome-to-my-website/bookmarks_1.png" alt="bookmark_1" width="191px" height="155px" /><img src="/static/images/welcome-to-my-website/bookmarks_2.png" alt="bookmark_2" width="191px" height="155px" />
</div>

I've always wanted to reproduce what caught my eye to wow the visitors to my website.
